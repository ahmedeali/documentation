Process receipts and deliveries in one step
===========================================

There is no configuration needed to receive or deliver products in one step. The default incoming
and outgoing shipments are configured to be directly received into stock, and directly delivered
from the stock to the customer.

Both incoming and outgoing shipments do not need to be configured to have the same steps. For
example products can be received in one step, but shipped in three steps. In the following example,
one step will be used for both receipts and deliveries.

Configuration
=============

If another receiving or shipping configuration is set on the warehouse, they can easily be set back
to one step. Go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`, click on the
warehouse to edit, then, click :guilabel:`Edit`. Select :guilabel:`Receive goods directly (1 step)`
for :guilabel:`Incoming Shipments` and :guilabel:`Deliver goods directly (1 step)` for
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments`, then save the changes
